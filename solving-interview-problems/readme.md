# Solving Interview Problems

Tips, strategies, and sample problems for the tech interview.

### How To Approach Interview Problems

1. **Understand the Problem**: Make sure you understand the problem before you start writing code. Ask clarifying questions if needed.
2. **Test Cases**: Make sure you understand the input and output requirements. Write down some test cases.
3. **Brute Force**: Start with a brute force solution. Write down the steps you would take to solve the problem in plain English.
4. **Optimize**: Once you have a working solution, think about how you can optimize it.
5. **Write Code**: Write the code for your optimized solution.
6. **Test**: Test your code with the test cases you wrote down earlier.
7. **Discuss**: Be prepared to discuss your solution with the interviewer.
8. **Practice**: Practice as many problems as you can to get better at solving them.

### One Way To Approach Interview Problems

The REACTO method is one easy-to-memorize set of steps for solving interview problems:

1. **Repeat**: Make sure you understand the problem by repeating it back to the interviewer.
2. **Examples**: Write down some examples and test cases.
3. **Approach**: Explain your approach to the interviewer.
4. **Code**: Write the code for your solution.
5. **Test**: Test your code with the examples you wrote down.
6. **Optimize**: Think about how you can optimize your solution.
